        interests of investors.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV):</span> Investments are made through an SPV, which is
        registered and compliant with relevant legal and regulatory authorities. SPVs are
        specifically used to isolate risks associated with specific assets or projects.</p>
    <p> <span style="font-weight: 700;">3.Equity Shares and Convertible Debentures:</span> Investors' investments are in the form
        of equity shares and convertible debentures in a Private Limited Company. This
        structure provides investors with ownership and potential financial benefits.</p>
    <p> <span style="font-weight: 700;">4. Purpose of the SPV:</span> The SPV is established solely for the purpose of acquiring and
        owning the asset in question. This narrow focus can help ring-fence the investment
        from the broader operations of FIRST/ASSET.</p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">5. Compliance:</span> The SPV is committed to complying with statutory requirements, such
        as holding general meetings and filing returns, which are managed by third-party
        consultants. This compliance helps ensure transparency and legal adherence.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">6. Investor Control:</span> The structure ensures that the ultimate decision-making power
        rests with the investors. This means that investors have a say in the direction and
        management of the asset, even if FIRST/ASSET faces challenges.</p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">7. Asset Ownership and Control:</span> Even if FIRST/ASSET becomes non-functional,
        investors' ownership and control of the asset remain secure. This SPV structure
        provides a level of protection for investors' interests.

        tax treaty rate.</p>
    <p style="padding-block: 10px;"> <span style="font-weight: 600;">4. Capital Appreciation:</span>  Capital gains tax applies to the appreciation of assets in

    <p style="padding-block: 10px;"> <span style="font-weight: 600;">5. Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA):</span>  NRIs can benefit from tax treaties
        (DTAA) between India and their home countries. These treaties may provide relief

        from double taxation. To avail of DTAA benefits, NRIs often need to obtain a Tax
        Residency Certificate from their home country.</p>
    <p style="padding-block: 10px;"> It&#39;s important for NRIs to stay informed about tax laws and seek guidance from
        tax
        professionals to ensure compliance with tax regulations and take advantage of any available
        tax benefits under DTAA agreements. Tax laws and treaties may change over time, so it&#39;s
