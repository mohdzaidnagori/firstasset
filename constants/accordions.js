        paragraph: `<p>1.Investment Security: Investors' investments are secure, regardless of what happens<br />
    to FIRST/ASSET as the investment structure has safeguards in place to protect the
    interests of investors.
    2. Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV): Investments are made through an SPV, which is
    registered and compliant with relevant legal and regulatory authorities. SPVs are
    specifically used to isolate risks associated with specific assets or projects.
    3. Equity Shares and Convertible Debentures: Investors' investments are in the form
    of equity shares and convertible debentures in a Private Limited Company. This
    structure provides investors with ownership and potential financial benefits.
    4. Purpose of the SPV: The SPV is established solely for the purpose of acquiring and
    owning the asset in question. This narrow focus can help ring-fence the investment
    from the broader operations of FIRST/ASSET.
    5. Compliance: The SPV is committed to complying with statutory requirements, such
    as holding general meetings and filing returns, which are managed by third-part
    consultants. This compliance helps ensure transparency and legal adherence.<br />
    6. Investor Control: The structure ensures that the ultimate decision-making power<br />
    rests with the investors. This means that investors have a say in the direction and<br />
    management of the asset, even if FIRST/ASSET faces challenges.<br />
    7. Asset Ownership and Control: Even if FIRST/ASSET becomes non-functional,<br />
    investors' ownership and control of the asset remain secure. This SPV structure<br />
    provides a level of protection for investors' interests.</p>`

        <p>NRIs often need to obtain a Tax<br />
        Residency Certificate from their home country.<br />
        It's important for NRIs to stay informed about</p>
        
        <p>tax laws and seek guidance from tax<br />
        professionals to ensure compliance with tax regulations</p>

        tax benefits under DTAA agreements. Tax laws and treaties</p>

        essential to verify the most up-to-date information from the</p>

        with tax experts when needed.</p>
